            <blockquote class="blockquote justify">I have passion for programming and software development. 
                I developed interest in coding when I started embedded systems programming during my bachelors 
                in electrical engineering from University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore. After that, 
                I did some self study in software programming and gained some initial experience in it. Currently,
                I am enrolled in Software Engineering Technology Fast Track program at Centennial College where 
                I learned advanced concepts in object oriented programming, technologies and frameworks for software, 
                web and mobile application development. I am skillful in object oriented programming and full stack development.</blockquote>
